# Salary-Prediction-Project-streamlit


**I am thrilled to present my portfolio project, which leverages machine learning to predict employee salaries based on key factors, including job title, years of experience, job satisfaction levels, and average monthly working hours.**


## Key Project Aspects:

**This project employs a comprehensive methodology to deliver accurate salary predictions:**


1. Data Analysis and Cleaning: Thorough data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to uncover valuable insights.

2. Data Visualization: Compelling visualizations to effectively communicate data stories.

3. Feature Engineering: Application of feature engineering principles to optimize model performance.

4. Machine Learning Modeling: Development, training, and evaluation of machine learning models using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Regressor.


Deployment:

To facilitate stakeholder engagement, I deployed the machine learning model on an interactive web application using Streamlit, enabling intuitive exploration of salary predictions.
